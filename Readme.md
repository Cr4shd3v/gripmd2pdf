# GripMd2Pdf

This is a small program to automatically start [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip)
and a headless chrome to convert a markdown file to pdf with chrome's print to pdf feature.

## Setup
- Install Chrome and [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip)
- Download [current release](https://github.com/Cr4shd3v/gripmd2pdf/releases/latest)
- Add the binary to your PATH

## Usage

```shell
gripmd2pdf <markdown file>
```

This will produce a file at the same path and filename, but with pdf as extension instead of md.
